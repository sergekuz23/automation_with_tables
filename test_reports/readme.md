Hello,
I want to apologize for the delay and thank you for your patience. 

This program requires Selenium and Pytest. You can find 'requirements.txt' in the package.
To run the file, please go to the terminal, switch to the directory '/test_reports/tests' and run the command 'pytest test_report.py -v'.
After the program is done, you'll be able to see the total number of tests as 'collected 9 items', the number of failed tests, the number of passed tests and the assertions with expected and discovered (you can find the screenshots in the package). 

I also noticed that the table has 4 columns, but it looks like 5 is expected, or one column is extra (Spend). Spend column has values without a '$' sign, but one column that did not fit had the correct data (see the screenshot).  Because of that extra column, both tables have shifted. 

I realize that there is some more testing that can be done on this page, but I didn't want to delay any longer. 
The video of the running program is attached.
Please, let me know if you have any questions.
